#' The spread function takes in a dataframe with 'words' and 'activation' columns, and
#' simulates the spread of activation of the words listed in the 'words' columns to its
#' neighbors in the specified network.
#'
#' @param start_run A non-empty dataframe with 'words' and 'activation' columns.
#' @param decay Proportion of activation that is lost at each time step, ranges from 0 to 1.
#' @param retention Proportion of activation that remains in the node, ranges from 0 to 1.
#' @param network Network where the spreading occurs.
#' @return A updated dataframe with 'words' and 'activation' columns with new activation values.
#' @examples
#' See Vignette for examples.
